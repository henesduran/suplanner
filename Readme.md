**Find your perfect schedule in seconds.**

This tool is designed to solve the chaos of course registration. It calculates every possible non-conflicting course schedule based on your preferences, helping you focus on choosing the best routine rather than checking for collisions manually.

> **✨ v2.0 Major Update:** > The project has been completely refactored to a **Client-Side (Serverless)** architecture. All computations now happen directly in your browser using **Web Workers**, ensuring zero latency and maximum privacy.

## 🌟 Key Features

### ⚡ Instant & Serverless
- **Zero Latency:** Schedule generation happens instantly on your device without waiting for a server.
- **Reliability:** Works 100% offline once loaded. No server downtimes or queues.
- **Privacy-First:** Your course selections and constraints never leave your browser.

### 🧠 Smart Scheduling & Controls
- **🔗 Auto-Corequisites (New):** Don't worry about missing labs. The system automatically adds mandatory corequisites (e.g., IF 100 ↔ IF 100R) when you select a course. Includes a toggle for manual control.
- **🔒 Section Pinning (New):** Have a favorite professor? Lock a specific section (e.g., "Pin Section A"), and the algorithm will generate schedules **around** that fixed choice.
- **⚔️ Allow Conflicts (New):** Some professors permit their lectures to overlap. Flip the toggle on any selected course and choose exactly which other classes it may clash with — its labs and recitations are covered automatically.
- **Conflict-Free Guarantee:** Uses a high-performance **Bitmask Algorithm** to detect overlaps in milliseconds.
- **Smart Grouping:** Automatically groups schedules that look identical visually to prevent clutter.

### 🎛️ Advanced Filtering
- **🚫 "No 8:40" Mode:** One-click filter to exclude all schedules starting at 8:40 AM.
- **🍔 Lunch Break Protection (New):** A dedicated filter to ensure your schedule always has a gap between 12:40 - 13:30 for food.
- **⏳ Minimize Gaps (New):** Smart sorting algorithm that prioritizes schedules with the least amount of waiting time between classes.
- **🏖️ Day Blocking:** Select specific days off (e.g., "I want Fridays empty") and the system will find schedules that fit.
  
### 🎨 User Experience
- **🌙 Dark Mode:** Fully supported dark theme that automatically saves your preference.
- **Visual Grid:** Interactive, color-coded grid to visualize your week at a glance.
- **Smart Navigation:** Easily browse through result options with jump controls.

### 📤 Ready for Registration
- **📋 Copy CRNs:** Found the perfect plan? Click one button to copy all Course Reference Numbers (CRNs) to your clipboard for easy registration.
- **📸 Download as Image:** Export your schedule as a high-quality PNG to save to your phone or share with friends.
